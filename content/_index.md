Dart is an awesome programming language and Flutter is a beautiful UI framework. But even with such a nice base code can get messy, unreadable and hard to understand.  
To avoid this numerous blogs, tutorials and the official documentation for Dart and Flutter provide information around those topics.  
But sometimes there are just small questions about best practices, about one particular pattern or syntax. This website tries to provide fast and short answers to common problems.  
This project aims to be an easily understandable, fast to read source for developers around the world. Itâ€™s created by developers, for developers. If you want to contribute feel free to do so, we would be quite happy.

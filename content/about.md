This project is a community driven approach to collect best practices around Dart and Flutter. This platform is meant to be an addition to the official guidelines. It could be considered as go-to source for fast information about a specific topic without reading a whole blog entry or watching a video tutorial.  
Everything you will find here will be as objective as possible, but as writing code often is highly subjective, don't just copy and paste everything you see here. Read and adapt the given suggestions to your needs. And if you find something which can be improved we would love to get your input. Further information about this can found in the contribution section of this page.
